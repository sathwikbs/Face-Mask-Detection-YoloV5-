# Face-Mask-Detection-YoloV5

Face coverings limit the volume and travel distance of expiratory droplets dispersed when talking, breathing, and coughing. A face covering without vents or holes will also filter out particles containing the virus from inhaled and exhaled air, reducing the chances of infection.

Technology Used:

Google Colab

YOLOv5(Ultralytics)

PyTorch

FastAPI
